# Shop-Assortiment
Easy website, which I use for leveling up my HTML, CSS and some JavaScript skills, because I am learning that languages right now. And it is my first repository on GitHub
 1. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
 2. It is no adaptive website, because i can't create adaptive website yet.
 3. It is like a mockup to Online Shop, so no logic with SQL or Backend yet.

Version: 1.0 (Some updates soon)
