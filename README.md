# Shop-Assortiment
Easy website, which I use for leveling up my HTML, CSS and some JavaScript skills, because I am learning that languages right now. And it is my first repository on GitHub
 1. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
 2. It is no adaptive website, because i can't create adaptive website yet.
 3. It is like a mockup to Online Shop, so no logic with SQL or Backend yet.
 4. I add a new part of page with something like price tag of product
 5. Registration part, working only for consol.log and converting name to numbers (no google sheets or  something like it yet)

Version: 1.2 (Some updates soon)
