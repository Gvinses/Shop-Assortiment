# Shop-Assortiment
Easy website, which I use for leveling up my HTML, CSS and some JavaScript skills, because I am learning that languages right now. 
 1. I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
 2. It is adaptive website(useing @media).
 3. It is like a mockup to Online Shop, so no logic with SQL or Backend yet.
 4. I add a new part of page with something like price tag of product
 5. Registration part, working only for consol.log and converting name to numbers (no google sheets or  something like it yet)

Version: 1.3 (Some updates soon)
